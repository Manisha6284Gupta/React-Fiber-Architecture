React Fiber is an ongoing reimplementation of React's core algorithm. It is the culmination of over two years of research by the React team.

The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. Its headline feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

Other key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.
What is reconciliation?
reconciliation
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
update
A change in the data used to render a React app. Usually the result of `setState`. Eventually results in a re-render.
The central idea of React's API is to think of updates as if they cause the entire app to re-render. This allows the developer to reason declaratively, rather than worry about how to efficiently transition the app from any particular state to another (A to B, B to C, C to A, and so on).

Actually re-rendering the entire app on each change only works for the most trivial apps; in a real-world app, it's prohibitively costly in terms of performance. React has optimizations which create the appearance of whole app re-rendering while maintaining great performance. The bulk of these optimizations are part of a process called reconciliation.
